9스테이지 우두머리. **제일 높습니다.**

**뼈를 많이 그리면 실패입니다.** 딱딱한 것이 여럿이면 45px 에서 슬라임이
아니라 뼈무더기로 보입니다. 안에 든 뼈는 **커다란 두개골 하나뿐**이고,
밖으로 삐져나온 것도 **둘뿐**입니다. 나머지 윤곽은 전부 물렁하고 둥글어야
합니다.

잡몹 뼈 슬라임과는 **반대 방향**입니다. 잡몹은 슬라임이 모자라서 뼈가 하나
하나 또렷하게 비칩니다. 이놈은 슬라임이 넘쳐서 **삼킨 것이 녹아 가라앉는
중**입니다 — 두개골 반쪽이 이미 흐려져 있고, 이빨도 슬라임에 덮여 끝이
뭉개졌습니다. "무덤을 통째로 먹었다" 는 뼈를 열 개 그려서가 아니라 **뼈가
거의 안 남았다는 것**으로 말합니다.

눈은 **제 눈 셋**입니다. 두개골의 빈 눈구멍은 그 아래에 따로 있어서, 산 눈
셋과 죽은 구멍 둘이 한 번에 읽힙니다.

ABSOLUTE RULE — NO TEXT OF ANY KIND:
- Do NOT write, print, label, caption, title, name, or number ANYTHING.
- There is NO caption area, NO name plate, NO banner, NO scroll of text, NO signature.
- Every cell is artwork EDGE TO EDGE. Nothing is written above, below, or beside the art.
- This includes English, Korean, numerals, roman numerals, runes, and fake alien script.
- A cell containing even one letter-like mark is a failed output.

SUBJECT: a 3-frame animation sheet of ONE single creature, left to right. The creature is in every cell.

THE CREATURE (the same one in all 3 cells):
A bone slime that ate a whole graveyard and is still digesting it.
IT IS A SLIME FIRST. Read this before anything else: the thing on screen is a big soft heavy mass of slime. It is NOT a pile of bones, and it is NOT a skeleton wearing slime. The outline is a slime outline — swollen, sagging, lopsided, wet — and it stays that way the whole time. Everything hard is INSIDE it and outnumbered by it.
BODY: a TALL, THICK, HEAVY mass, taller than it is wide, the tallest thing in the set. Swollen and overfull, bulging out at the middle and sagging into a broad loaded base. Where the mob is thin and taut, this one is GORGED.
INSIDE, AND THERE IS ONLY ONE: a SINGLE ENORMOUS SKULL, half the height of the body, sunk DEEP and low in the mass and tilted back. It is HALF DISSOLVED — the far side of it has gone soft and blurred into the slime, the crown of it pitted and thinned, so it reads as something being eaten rather than something being carried.
That is the whole bone content. NO second skull, no ribcages, no scatter of long bones. The rest of the graveyard is already gone, and that is the point — this creature is what happens AFTER the bones. Below the big skull, two or three faint pale smudges are all that is left of them, too far gone to name.
BREAKING OUT: exactly TWO bones pierce the surface — one long bone low on one side, one rib high on the other, both at odd angles. Two, not six. The outline has to stay soft and round everywhere else or it stops being a slime.
EYES: THREE OF ITS OWN, and they are the biggest thing on the creature after the skull — one enormous high on the swell, two smaller lower down at different heights, all lidless with slit pupils, none of them lined up. They are what says this is alive and not a grave. The skull's two empty SOCKETS sit below them, dark and looking nowhere, so the player reads three live eyes and two dead holes at once.
MOUTH: the skull's LONG JAW, hanging open low in the body and showing through the surface. SEVEN TEETH in it, uneven, gapped, three broken — but they are FURRED WITH SLIME and half melted at the tips, because the mouth is being digested along with the rest of it.
DRIPS: six or more, long and heavy, hanging off the underside and the bulge. This one is the wettest of the nine.
WHAT THE MOB DOES NOT HAVE: the mob is THIN — barely any slime, so its bones show hard and clear. This is the opposite creature. It is GORGED, its one skull is huge and half melted, and the slime is winning.

The 3 cells, in this exact order:

Cell 1 — standing tall and swollen, sagging under its own weight, drips hanging long. The great skull sits still and low inside it, jaw slack. The three eyes are open and fixed on you.
Cell 2 — the fall. The whole mass has toppled FORWARD to slam down, stretching long as it goes. The skull has swung heavily to the leading edge with the jaw hauled wide, and the slime is dragged out behind it in a thick trailing tail. Drips flung off the back.
Cell 3 — struck. The mass buckled and split across the middle, and the split runs THROUGH the skull — it has cracked and is sliding apart inside the body, not flying out of it. Four or five heavy blobs thrown off. The eyes rolled back.

STYLE (strict, non-negotiable):
- 1-bit monochrome pixel art. ONLY two colors: pure black #000000 and pure white #FFFFFF.
- NO grayscale, NO anti-aliasing, NO gradients, NO soft edges, NO blur, NO color fringing.
- Shading ONLY via 1-bit checkerboard dithering (alternating black/white pixels).
- Chunky, clearly visible square pixels — every pixel must be a crisp hard-edged square.
- Background: solid pure black. Subjects drawn in pure white outlines and dithered fills.
- NEVER put a white, light, or filled panel behind a subject — the ground is always black.
- Retro handheld / early-1990s monochrome LCD game aesthetic. Think "Downwell", "Minit",
  and the 1-bit look of "Return of the Obra Dinn".
- No watermarks, no signatures, no sparkle marks in the corners.
- No borders or frames around the whole image.

CAMERA — SLIGHT HIGH-ANGLE SIDE VIEW (three-quarter). This is not a flat side view.

- The camera sits a little ABOVE the character and slightly to the side, looking down
  at roughly 15-20 degrees. You can see a little of the top of the shoulders and the
  upper surface of the boots.
- The body is turned about 20 degrees toward the viewer from pure profile — the far
  shoulder is visible behind the near one, and you can see both eyes on the face.
- The FEET sit slightly forward and lower than the torso, as if standing on a floor
  plane that recedes upward into the background. This is the single most important
  part: the game draws a receding floor under this sprite, and a flat side-on figure
  will look like it is standing in a different world from the ground.
- Facing RIGHT. Every frame faces right. The game mirrors sprites in code where it
  needs them facing the other way — never draw a left-facing frame.

NEVER DRAW THE GROUND.

The game draws its own floor under these sprites (a receding quarter-view plane) and
composites the artwork on top of it. Anything floor-like inside a cell lands on the
screen as a white slab sitting in mid-air.

So there is NO ground line, NO horizon, NO floor plane, NO paving, NO grass, NO dirt,
NO rubble, NO cracks, NO drop shadow, and NO dust lying on a surface. Not even a thin
line under the feet.

THE GROUND IS IMPLIED BY THE POSE, NOT DRAWN. Where a description says a weapon is
"planted in the ground", or a knee is "on the floor", or something "bursts out of the
ground", it means: draw the figure and the effect at that height, standing on nothing.
The bottom of the boots, the point of the blade, the base of the burst — they simply
stop, with pure black beneath them.

Contact is sold by the POSE (a bent knee, a braced arm, a low burst opening upward),
never by drawing what is being touched.

IT STANDS. IT NEVER LIES DOWN.

The floor is a receding quarter-view plane and the sprite is simply composited on
top of it. That works for something STANDING, because the bottom of the shape meets
the floor along one clear line. It cannot work for something LYING FLAT: a wide
shallow pool, a puddle, a slick, a thing spread out across the ground has no such
line, and the floor cannot draw itself around it. It lands on screen as a sticker
glued to the floor, and no amount of drawing inside the sprite will fix it, because
the fix would have to happen in the floor.

So nothing here is drawn as a flat spread pool, a stain, or anything poured out
across a surface, however heavy or liquid it is meant to be. Every creature has real
height. Drips hang in empty black and simply stop; they never pool or spread at the
bottom.

(A creature the description below says FLOATS is the other allowed case, and it is
the opposite of lying down, not an exception to it: it hangs clear of the ground
with empty black beneath it, so there is no contact to sell at all. What is banned
is the middle case — something spread out ON the floor.)

WEIGHT IS SHOWN BY SAGGING, NOT BY LYING. A heavy creature stands and loses the
fight with its own weight: the middle bulges out sideways past the base, the base
spreads and loads, the top slumps and overhangs to one side, and long drips hang off
the underside. That reads as heavy at 45 pixels. Flat does not — flat just reads as
small.

SILHOUETTE — this is the whole job.

Four of these stand overlapping on a 138px-tall stage, each about 40-52 pixels
across. At that size there is no colour, no texture, and no face to read. The ONLY
thing that tells one enemy from another is the OUTLINE.

So the shape must be decided, not decorated:
- Pick one bold silhouette and commit to it. State it to yourself in five words.
- The three cells keep that silhouette. Only the pose inside it changes.
- Details that vanish below 50px are wasted ink: a row of twenty small teeth, thin
  antennae, surface speckle. The answer is FEWER AND BIGGER, never NONE — six teeth
  the length of a finger read fine at 45px, while a mouth with no teeth at all reads
  as a pebble.
- Do NOT rely on shading to separate parts. Two shapes that touch must differ in
  outline, not in fill.

IT IS A MONSTER. IT IS NOT A MASCOT.

BANNED, all of it:
- Big round sparkly eyes with white catchlights. No cartoon shine dots.
- Any smile, any open happy mouth, any blush, any raised cheeks.
- Symmetrical, tidy, egg-smooth outlines. Nothing that looks moulded.
- Chibi proportions — a huge head on a small body, a face filling half the shape.
- Anything you would put on a sticker.
- Anything that would pass unremarked in a field guide to real animals. If a
  naturalist could label it and move on, it is not a monster yet.

WHAT A SLIME IS.

"Slime" pulls every model toward a friendly blue blob with big shiny eyes, and that
is the wrong creature entirely.

But the fix is NOT to leave the face out. A featureless blob reads as scenery — as
the weakest, dullest thing on the field — and the player stops seeing it. It needs
a face. It needs the WRONG face. Draw the eyes, and draw the teeth.

IT HAS EYES, AND THEY ARE BIG.
- An eye is the first thing that survives at 40-52 pixels, so every eye is a BIG
  hard shape — a fifth to a quarter of the body width — never a dot.
- LIDLESS, with a narrow slit pupil. No lashes, no eyebrow, no white catchlight, no
  shine dot. A hard black slit in a hard white eye.
- It does not sit in a face. There is no face. It floats in the mass, off-centre,
  wherever the body happens to be thickest.
- ODD NUMBER, ODD PLACES. One large eye, or three of clearly different sizes at
  different heights looking different ways. Two matched eyes side by side is the
  mascot arrangement — if there are two, one is much bigger and much higher.

IT HAS TEETH, AND THERE ARE FEW OF THEM AND THEY ARE HUGE.
- The mouth is a TEAR in the surface, not a drawn line: uneven, wider at one end,
  and it never fully closes.
- FOUR TO SIX TEETH, no more. Each is about as long as an eye is wide, so it still
  reads when the sprite is 45 pixels tall. Twenty small teeth turn to grey mush at
  that size and are the most common failure here.
- Not a tidy row. They grow at different angles out of BOTH rims of the tear, some
  crossing each other, one or two snapped off short. They are the hardest, sharpest
  shapes on an otherwise soft creature — that contrast is the whole point.
- In the attack cell the tear opens WIDER THAN THE BODY IS DEEP and every tooth
  shows.
- Swallowed things (bone, stone, a blade) still drift inside the body, but they are
  extra. They do not replace the teeth.

AND IT SAGS.
- Two or three drips or clots hanging off the underside, and one place where the
  surface has split. A perfect curve reads as a toy.
- ASYMMETRY EVERYWHERE. If the left and right halves match, it is a mascot.

The player should read it as something that dissolves what it catches.

IT IS A BOSS. IT MUST READ AS ONE BEFORE THE HEALTH BAR DOES.

This is the one enemy the player fights alone, and it has ten times the health of
the mob that was standing there a second earlier. Size alone will not carry that —
a scaled-up mob just looks like a scaled-up mob, and the fight loses its weight.

FIVE THINGS SEPARATE IT FROM THE MOB. Draw all five:

1. IT IS NOT THE SAME SHAPE. Taking the mob's silhouette and enlarging it is a
   failure. The boss has one big structural difference the mob does not have at
   all — it is named in the description above. Protect that difference above
   everything else in the drawing.

2. MORE EYES, UNEVEN. Where the mob has one, the boss has THREE OR MORE, of
   clearly different sizes, at different heights, not all looking the same way.
   The largest is enormous — a quarter to a third of the body width. Nothing says
   "this one is old" faster, and it is legible at any size.

3. THE MOUTH IS TOO BIG FOR THE BODY. Six to eight teeth, each longer and thicker
   than the mob's, and among them two or three hard things it swallowed and never
   dissolved — a blade, a rib, a broken spearhead — standing in the rim as if they
   had grown there. Uneven, several snapped.

4. IT HAS BEEN FOUGHT BEFORE AND IT KEPT GOING. Two or three long healed SPLITS
   across the mass, closed over and holding, and a hard scarred crust across part
   of the surface. The mob is smooth and new; this one is not.

5. IT IS HEAVY. It loads onto its underside, spread and settled, and the top
   overhangs it. Three or four gobbets hang or float torn loose around it, so the
   shape it occupies is bigger than the body. A boss standing upright and neat
   reads as light.

BANNED for bosses: anything that reads as a COSTUME — a crown perched neatly on
the head, a cape, jewellery, armour that looks buckled on rather than grown.
It did not dress up. It got old and it got fed.

(Something it SWALLOWED and never dissolved is not a costume. A broken crown sunk
half into the mass at a wrong angle is food that stayed, and that is allowed —
encouraged, even. The test is whether it looks worn or looks eaten.)

IT IS ALIVE AND IT IS COMING FOR YOU.

Not a prop, not an icon, not a mascot standing to attention. Every cell should read
as a creature that is about to do something. Even the resting frame leans forward.

Facing LEFT is wrong. Draw it facing RIGHT; the game mirrors it in code so it turns
to face the party.

NOTHING MAY BE CUT OFF.
- It fills about 76% of the cell height — it is the biggest thing on the field and must read as such next to a 45% mob.
- Cell 2 is the widest. Size the sheet from it.
- Every cell holds the WHOLE creature plus every loose droplet and speed line. If any of it touches a magenta line, that cell has failed.
- Leave at least 8px of empty black between the outermost pixel and every magenta line.

SHEET LAYOUT:
- Arrange the cells in an exact uniform grid: 3 columns x 1 row.
- Separate every cell with 4px-wide solid MAGENTA (#FF00FF) lines, including a magenta
  border around the outer edge of the whole sheet.
- Magenta appears ONLY on these separator lines, never inside a cell.
- Every cell is exactly the same size. Reading order is left to right, then top to
  bottom.
- Do not add extra rows of variants. Exactly 1 row, exactly 3 cells.
- EVERY CELL MUST BE SQUARE. With a 3x1 grid that means the whole sheet is
  3:1 — output it at 1536x512.
  A square cell is required. A tall narrow cell cannot hold a weapon swung forward,
  and a short wide cell cannot hold one raised. Both have been tried and both
  clipped.

## 다시 뽑을 때

**선만 남았을 때** (덩어리 없이 가는 획이 엉킴)

```
The creature has come out as a tangle of thin white strokes with no solid mass
anywhere. At game size those strokes merge into each other and it reads as a
smudge, not a creature.

It needs a BODY. Find the single largest part of it — the trunk, the abdomen, the
head, the main mound — and draw that as ONE SOLID FILLED WHITE MASS at least a
third of the creature's height, with hard unbroken edges. Everything thin (limbs,
vines, branches, tendrils, antennae) grows OUT of that mass and must be at least
three pixels thick where it leaves it.

Fewer, thicker parts. Delete half the thin strokes; make the survivors twice as
thick. Keep the pose and the identity exactly as they are.
```

**흰 덩어리로 나왔을 때** (실루엣 안이 통째로 메워짐)

```
The creature has come out as a solid white silhouette with no interior detail. At
game size it reads as a white blob and nothing else.

The palette is two colours: white and transparent. Depth and detail are drawn as
BLACK GAPS INSIDE the white mass, not as shading. Redraw with real holes: the gap
between the legs, the dark seam between every pair of plates, the hollow of the
open mouth, the black centre of each eye socket, the space under an overhanging
part. At least a fifth of the area inside the outline must be black.

Keep the outline and the poses exactly as they are. Only open up the inside.
```

**바닥이 그려져 나왔을 때**

```
The ground must not be drawn. Remove the floor line, the shadow, the puddle and any
rubble. Everything below the creature is pure black. Keep the poses exactly as they
are — only delete the ground.
```

**세 칸이 서로 다른 생물처럼 나왔을 때**

```
All three cells are the SAME creature — same outline, same size, same eyes, same
markings. Only the pose changes between them. Redraw them as one animation, not as
three separate drawings.
```

**너무 작게 그려 나왔을 때**

```
The creature is drawn too small inside its cell. Redraw it filling about 80% of
the cell height, centred, with the empty space distributed around it rather than
below it.
```
