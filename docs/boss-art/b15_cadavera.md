15스테이지 우두머리. 후반 챕터 전반부의 마지막이고, **패시브 보유자**입니다.

패시브 **부패의 오라**는 탱커의 방어력을 0 으로 만들고 계속 태웁니다. 그림
쪽에서는 **꽃잎 바깥면이 썩어 있는 것**이 그것이고, 다섯 칸 전부에 있어야
합니다 — 피격 칸에도요.

3번 칸은 **이 시트에서 유일하게 대기보다 낮습니다.** 꽃이 활짝 열리면서
납작해지기 때문입니다. 다른 우두머리는 기술을 쓸 때 커지는데 이놈만 반대라,
연달아 보면 그것만으로 구분됩니다.

**때리는 그림이 아닙니다.** 열리는 그림입니다.

## 이 우두머리가 하는 것

그림의 자세는 전부 여기서 나옵니다. **무엇을 하는 기술인지가 어떤 모양이어야
하는지를 정합니다** — 전원을 치는 기술은 넓거나 높고, 한 명을 크게 치는 기술은
길고 좁습니다.

**패시브 · 부패의 오라** — 탱커 아군의 방어력을 0으로 만들고, 1초마다 공격력의 5%만큼 지속 마법 피해
(싸우는 내내 화면 위쪽에 로고가 떠 있습니다 → [`BOSS_PASSIVE_PROMPTS.md`](../BOSS_PASSIVE_PROMPTS.md))

**평타** — 한 명에게 보통 피해. 시트에서 제일 자주 보이는 칸이라 제일 절제되어야 합니다.

**스킬 1 · 부패의 악취** (`skill1` 칸) — 아군 전체에 4초간 지속 마법 피해 (0.5초마다 공격력의 10%), 5초간 침묵 (스킬 사용 불가) (평타 6대마다)

ABSOLUTE RULE — NO TEXT OF ANY KIND:
- Do NOT write, print, label, caption, title, name, or number ANYTHING.
- There is NO caption area, NO name plate, NO banner, NO scroll of text, NO signature.
- Every cell is artwork EDGE TO EDGE. Nothing is written above, below, or beside the art.
- This includes English, Korean, numerals, roman numerals, runes, and fake alien script.
- A cell containing even one letter-like mark is a failed output.

SUBJECT: a 4-frame animation sheet of ONE single creature, left to right. The creature is in every cell.

THE CREATURE (the same one in all 4 cells):
A single flower the size of a cart, and the smell arrived before it did.
BODY: ONE ENORMOUS BLOOM and almost nothing else. Five heavy leathery petals, thick as doors, curving up and outward from a deep central well, held HALF CLOSED so the bloom reads as a fat closed fist of petals rather than an open flower. Two petals are torn at the edge and one has folded over on itself and stuck.
THE STEM is short and thick and barely visible under the bloom — the flower sits almost on its own root knot. It is squat, not tall.
THE CENTRAL WELL, visible down between the petals, holds a thick pale COLUMN rising from the middle, blunt-tipped, ringed with fine hairs.
THE PASSIVE — draw it in every cell: the outer surface of every petal is ROTTING. Dark sunken patches with ragged holes eaten through them, edges curling black, and SIX heavy hanging strands of decayed matter trailing off the petal rims into empty black. The rot is structural and permanent, never an effect and never absent — not even in the struck cell.
EYES: FOUR, set into the outer faces of four different petals, one large and three small, all at different heights so they never read as a face.
THE ACCIDENT — this one only: a full RIBCAGE is caught upside down between two petals at the rim, held by the petals having grown through the gaps between the ribs, so it cannot be pulled out. It hangs half outside the bloom.
ROOTS: a broad low knot, splayed, more of it above ground than below.

The 4 cells, in this exact order:

Cell 1 — the bloom held half closed and hanging slightly forward, petals still, strands of rot hanging, the ribcage caught at the rim. The smallest silhouette it ever has.
Cell 2 — the snap. Two of the five petals have swung forward and closed on something ahead of the bloom, thrown out past the root knot, the pale column driven forward between them. The other three petals stay where they are. Two petals, forward, short.
Cell 3 — THE OPENING — it hits EVERYONE and silences them, and it is not a strike at all: it is the flower opening. All five petals have swung FULLY BACK AND FLAT, spread out level like a plate, so the bloom has gone from a closed fist to the widest flat shape on the sheet — three times its idle width, and much LOWER, because opening flattened it. The central column stands fully exposed and upright in the middle, the only vertical thing left. Rising off the whole open face, TWELVE heavy clumps of rot are lifting away in every direction, evenly spread, with no direction of travel. The ribcage has swung out flat with its petal. It is the WIDEST and FLATTEST cell on the sheet — and note this is the one boss whose skill makes it SHORTER than its idle pose.
Cell 4 — struck. Three petals are split from rim to base and folding down, the central column snapped over halfway up, the bloom collapsing in on itself. The ribcage has torn free of the petals it was caught in.

STYLE (strict, non-negotiable):
- 1-bit monochrome pixel art. ONLY two colors: pure black #000000 and pure white #FFFFFF.
- NO grayscale, NO anti-aliasing, NO gradients, NO soft edges, NO blur, NO color fringing.
- Shading ONLY via 1-bit checkerboard dithering (alternating black/white pixels).
- Chunky, clearly visible square pixels — every pixel must be a crisp hard-edged square.
- Background: solid pure black. Subjects drawn in pure white outlines and dithered fills.
- NEVER put a white, light, or filled panel behind a subject — the ground is always black.
- Retro handheld / early-1990s monochrome LCD game aesthetic. Think "Downwell", "Minit",
  and the 1-bit look of "Return of the Obra Dinn".
- No watermarks, no signatures, no sparkle marks in the corners.
- No borders or frames around the whole image.

CAMERA — SLIGHT HIGH-ANGLE SIDE VIEW (three-quarter). This is not a flat side view.

- The camera sits a little ABOVE the character and slightly to the side, looking down
  at roughly 15-20 degrees. You can see a little of the top of the shoulders and the
  upper surface of the boots.
- The body is turned about 20 degrees toward the viewer from pure profile — the far
  shoulder is visible behind the near one, and you can see both eyes on the face.
- The FEET sit slightly forward and lower than the torso, as if standing on a floor
  plane that recedes upward into the background. This is the single most important
  part: the game draws a receding floor under this sprite, and a flat side-on figure
  will look like it is standing in a different world from the ground.
- Facing RIGHT. Every frame faces right. The game mirrors sprites in code where it
  needs them facing the other way — never draw a left-facing frame.

NEVER DRAW THE GROUND.

The game draws its own floor under these sprites (a receding quarter-view plane) and
composites the artwork on top of it. Anything floor-like inside a cell lands on the
screen as a white slab sitting in mid-air.

So there is NO ground line, NO horizon, NO floor plane, NO paving, NO grass, NO dirt,
NO rubble, NO cracks, NO drop shadow, and NO dust lying on a surface. Not even a thin
line under the feet.

THE GROUND IS IMPLIED BY THE POSE, NOT DRAWN. Where a description says a weapon is
"planted in the ground", or a knee is "on the floor", or something "bursts out of the
ground", it means: draw the figure and the effect at that height, standing on nothing.
The bottom of the boots, the point of the blade, the base of the burst — they simply
stop, with pure black beneath them.

Contact is sold by the POSE (a bent knee, a braced arm, a low burst opening upward),
never by drawing what is being touched.

IT STANDS. IT NEVER LIES DOWN.

The floor is a receding quarter-view plane and the sprite is simply composited on
top of it. That works for something STANDING, because the bottom of the shape meets
the floor along one clear line. It cannot work for something LYING FLAT: a wide
shallow pool, a puddle, a slick, a thing spread out across the ground has no such
line, and the floor cannot draw itself around it. It lands on screen as a sticker
glued to the floor, and no amount of drawing inside the sprite will fix it, because
the fix would have to happen in the floor.

So nothing here is drawn as a flat spread pool, a stain, or anything poured out
across a surface, however heavy or liquid it is meant to be. Every creature has real
height. Drips hang in empty black and simply stop; they never pool or spread at the
bottom.

(A creature the description below says FLOATS is the other allowed case, and it is
the opposite of lying down, not an exception to it: it hangs clear of the ground
with empty black beneath it, so there is no contact to sell at all. What is banned
is the middle case — something spread out ON the floor.)

WEIGHT IS SHOWN BY SAGGING, NOT BY LYING. A heavy creature stands and loses the
fight with its own weight: the middle bulges out sideways past the base, the base
spreads and loads, the top slumps and overhangs to one side, and long drips hang off
the underside. That reads as heavy at 45 pixels. Flat does not — flat just reads as
small.

SILHOUETTE — this is the whole job.

Four of these stand overlapping on a 138px-tall stage, each about 40-52 pixels
across. At that size there is no colour, no texture, and no face to read. The ONLY
thing that tells one enemy from another is the OUTLINE.

So the shape must be decided, not decorated:
- Pick one bold silhouette and commit to it. State it to yourself in five words.
- The three cells keep that silhouette. Only the pose inside it changes.
- Details that vanish below 50px are wasted ink: a row of twenty small teeth, thin
  antennae, surface speckle. The answer is FEWER AND BIGGER, never NONE — six teeth
  the length of a finger read fine at 45px, while a mouth with no teeth at all reads
  as a pebble.
- Do NOT rely on shading to separate parts. Two shapes that touch must differ in
  outline, not in fill.

IT IS A MONSTER. IT IS NOT A MASCOT.

BANNED, all of it:
- Big round sparkly eyes with white catchlights. No cartoon shine dots.
- Any smile, any open happy mouth, any blush, any raised cheeks.
- Symmetrical, tidy, egg-smooth outlines. Nothing that looks moulded.
- Chibi proportions — a huge head on a small body, a face filling half the shape.
- Anything you would put on a sticker.
- Anything that would pass unremarked in a field guide to real animals. If a
  naturalist could label it and move on, it is not a monster yet.

WHAT THIS IS: SOMETHING THAT GREW, AND KEPT GROWING AFTER IT SHOULD HAVE STOPPED.

A plant or a tree that hunts. It is not an ent, not a treant, not a person made of
wood. There is no face carved into a trunk and no arms in the shape of arms.

- IT GREW INTO THIS SHAPE. Every part is growth — a stem, a cane, a root, a
  branch — that went where it should not have gone. Nothing is built, jointed, or
  attached.
- IT REACHES BY GROWING, NOT BY SWINGING. What comes at you is longer in the
  attack cells than in the idle cell, because it extended, not because it moved.
- ASYMMETRY IS THE RULE. One side is heavier, longer, more broken. A plant that
  mirrors itself reads as a decoration.
- WHAT IT CAUGHT IS HELD IN THE GROWTH — bone, iron, worked stone — grown around
  and half swallowed, never tied on or balanced on top.
- DEAD AND LIVING TOGETHER: part of it is grey, split and hollow, and new growth
  comes out of the dead part. That contrast is what says it is old.

IT IS A BOSS. IT MUST READ AS ONE BEFORE THE HEALTH BAR DOES.

This is the one enemy the player fights alone. It has more than ten times the
health of the mob that was standing there a second earlier, and the fight lasts
long enough to look at it. Size alone will not carry that — a scaled-up mob just
looks like a scaled-up mob.

FIVE THINGS SEPARATE IT FROM THE MOB. Draw all five:

1. IT IS NOT THE SAME SHAPE. Taking a mob silhouette and enlarging it is a
   failure. This creature has one big structural difference no mob has at all —
   it is named in the description above. Protect that difference above everything
   else in the drawing.

2. MORE EYES, UNEVEN. Three or more, of clearly different sizes, at different
   heights, not all looking the same way. The largest is enormous — a quarter to
   a third of the body width. Nothing says "this one is old" faster, and it is
   legible at any size.

3. THE MOUTH IS TOO BIG FOR THE BODY. Six to eight teeth, each longer and thicker
   than a mob's, and among them two or three hard things it swallowed and never
   dissolved — a blade, a rib, a broken spearhead — standing in the rim as if they
   had grown there. Uneven, several snapped.

4. IT HAS BEEN FOUGHT BEFORE AND IT KEPT GOING. Two or three long healed SPLITS
   across the mass, closed over and holding, and a hard scarred crust across part
   of the surface. A mob is smooth and new; this one is not.

5. IT IS HEAVY. It loads onto its underside, spread and settled, and the top
   overhangs it. Three or four gobbets hang or float torn loose around it, so the
   shape it occupies is bigger than the body.

BANNED: anything that reads as a COSTUME — a crown perched neatly on the head, a
cape, jewellery, armour that looks buckled on rather than grown. It did not dress
up. It got old and it got fed.

(Something it SWALLOWED and never dissolved is not a costume. A broken crown sunk
half into the mass at a wrong angle is food that stayed, and that is allowed —
encouraged, even. The test is whether it looks worn or looks eaten.)

THIS ONE HAS A NAME. IT IS AN INDIVIDUAL, NOT A SPECIES.

Every other enemy in this game is one of many — there are eight of that slime
standing in a row. This one is the only one there has ever been, and the player
is told its name when it arrives.

So it must not look like a well-drawn example of its kind. Something about it has
to be an ACCIDENT that happened to this one creature and could not repeat: a
specific thing lodged in it at a specific angle, a specific break healed a
specific wrong way, a growth that went in a direction the others do not go. That
accident is named in the description above. It is the most important shape on the
sheet after the overall silhouette, and it is present and identical in EVERY cell
— it does not appear only when convenient.

EVERY CELL IS A DIFFERENT MOTION. THIS IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS SHEET.

The game swaps between these cells during the fight. The player must be able to
tell WHICH ONE is on screen from the silhouette alone, in about a fifth of a
second, at 60 pixels tall. If two cells have similar outlines, the fight looks
like one animation stuck on repeat, and the skills stop meaning anything.

So the cells are separated by DIRECTION and by REACH, not by detail:

- IDLE occupies the creature's ordinary shape. It is the baseline every other
  cell is measured against. It still leans forward — it is waiting, not posing.
- THE ORDINARY ATTACK goes FORWARD and stays SHORT. It hits one character for a
  normal amount. Part of the creature reaches out past the body; the mass stays
  where it is. This is the cell the player sees most often, so it must be the
  most restrained.
- EACH SKILL BREAKS OUT OF THE BODY IN ITS OWN DIRECTION, and that direction is
  decided by what the skill actually does in the game (stated per cell below).
  A skill that hits the whole party goes WIDE or UP and the whole mass commits.
  A skill that hits one character very hard goes LONG and NARROW and aims at one
  point. Those two must never look alike.
- DOWN is struck. Something has failed structurally — split, torn off, buckled.
  It is the only cell where the creature is losing.

TEST: put the cells side by side and squint until they blur. If you cannot say
which is which, redraw. Changing a detail is not enough; change the outline.

DRAWING A SKILL CELL.

- IT IS THE WIDEST OR THE TALLEST CELL of the sheet, and which one depends on the
  skill. Whatever the creature normally occupies, this pose breaks out of it in
  ONE clear direction.
- THE WHOLE BODY COMMITS. Not one limb — the mass itself is thrown into it, and
  the parts that normally trail behind are flung wide.
- SOMETHING LEAVES THE BODY. Three or four loose pieces (spores, splinters,
  thorns, clods, drops) in the air around it, clear of the outline. That is what
  says the attack reaches past arm's length.
- THE POSE IS HELD, not mid-swing. It is one frame; a blur reads as nothing. Draw
  the instant of maximum extension, when everything has already been thrown and
  nothing has come back yet.

Do NOT draw impact marks, shockwave rings, motion arcs, or the ground cracking.
The game draws its own effects on top, and a ring drawn into the sprite lands on
screen as a white smear that never goes away.

IT IS ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING, EVEN STANDING STILL.

This creature has a passive ability that never turns off, and the game shows a
small logo at the top of the screen for the whole fight to say so. The sprite has
to agree with that logo: the thing the passive does must be VISIBLE IN EVERY
CELL, including idle and including down.

It is named in the description above. Draw it as a permanent structural feature,
not as an effect — an effect drawn into the sprite becomes a white smear that
never goes away.

IT IS ALIVE AND IT IS COMING FOR YOU.

Not a prop, not an icon, not a mascot standing to attention. Every cell should read
as a creature that is about to do something. Even the resting frame leans forward.

Facing LEFT is wrong. Draw it facing RIGHT; the game mirrors it in code so it turns
to face the party.

NOTHING MAY BE CUT OFF.
- It fills about 70% of the cell height in the idle cell. It is the only creature on the field and it must read as such.
- Size the sheet from the LARGEST cell, not from idle. The skill cells break out of the body and they must still fit.
- Every cell holds the WHOLE creature plus every loose piece. If any of it touches a magenta line, that cell has failed.
- Leave at least 8px of empty black between the outermost pixel and every magenta line.

SHEET LAYOUT:
- Arrange the cells in an exact uniform grid: 4 columns x 1 row.
- Separate every cell with 4px-wide solid MAGENTA (#FF00FF) lines, including a magenta
  border around the outer edge of the whole sheet.
- Magenta appears ONLY on these separator lines, never inside a cell.
- Every cell is exactly the same size. Reading order is left to right, then top to
  bottom.
- Do not add extra rows of variants. Exactly 1 row, exactly 4 cells.
- EVERY CELL MUST BE SQUARE. With a 4x1 grid that means the whole sheet is
  4:1 — output it at 2048x512.
  A square cell is required. A tall narrow cell cannot hold a weapon swung forward,
  and a short wide cell cannot hold one raised. Both have been tried and both
  clipped.

## 다시 뽑을 때

**칸들이 서로 너무 비슷하게 나왔을 때** (제일 자주 납니다)

```
The cells are too similar to each other. They must be distinguishable from the
SILHOUETTE ALONE at 60 pixels tall. Redraw so that each cell breaks out of the
creature's ordinary shape in a different direction: the ordinary attack reaches
forward and stays short, and each skill cell goes the way its own description
says — wide, or tall, or long and narrow. Do not distinguish them by detail.
```

**바닥이 그려져 나왔을 때**

```
The ground must not be drawn. Remove the floor line, the shadow, the puddle and any
rubble. Everything below and around the creature is pure black. Keep the poses
exactly as they are — only delete the ground.
```

**칸마다 다른 생물처럼 나왔을 때**

```
All 4 cells are the SAME creature — same outline, same size, same eyes,
same markings, same swallowed objects in the same places. Only the pose changes
between them. Redraw them as one animation, not as 4 separate drawings.
```

**너무 작게 그려 나왔을 때**

```
The creature is drawn too small inside its cell. Redraw it filling about 70%
of the cell height, centred, with the empty space distributed around it rather than
below it.
```
