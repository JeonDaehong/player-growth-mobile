**딱딱한 판이 곡선 위에 얹힌 대비**가 실루엣의 전부입니다. 돌 슬라임
(`sg_stone`)과 같은 원리인데, 이쪽은 돌이 아니라 **나무껍질**이고 훨씬
큽니다.

판 사이 틈으로 물러 썩은 속이 보여야 합니다. 그게 이놈의 유일한 무른
부분이고, 갑옷이 통째가 아니라 **덧댄 것**이라는 표시입니다.

ABSOLUTE RULE — NO TEXT OF ANY KIND:
- Do NOT write, print, label, caption, title, name, or number ANYTHING.
- There is NO caption area, NO name plate, NO banner, NO scroll of text, NO signature.
- Every cell is artwork EDGE TO EDGE. Nothing is written above, below, or beside the art.
- This includes English, Korean, numerals, roman numerals, runes, and fake alien script.
- A cell containing even one letter-like mark is a failed output.

SUBJECT: a 3-frame animation sheet of ONE single creature, left to right. The creature is in every cell.

THE CREATURE (the same one in all 3 cells):
A tree that answered being cut by growing armour.
BODY: a THICK COLUMN, taller than wide, leaning but massive — the heaviest silhouette in this chapter.
THE PLATES ARE THE READ: SIX OR SEVEN slabs of bark, hard and STRAIGHT-EDGED, standing proud of the trunk and overlapping each other down the front and one shoulder. They are angular shapes on an otherwise round outline, and that contrast is the whole silhouette. One large plate at the top, the rest smaller and irregular.
THE LARGEST PLATE IS SPLIT across, and has been GROWN BACK TOGETHER — a hard ridge along the join.
BETWEEN TWO PLATES on the front, wedged where it could not be pushed out: A SPEARHEAD, snapped off at the socket.
THE GAPS between plates show soft dark rot underneath. That is the only soft part of it.
THE OPENING is a horizontal split between the two lowest plates, held apart, with FOUR HARD SPLINTERS inside.
ROOTS: four, short and thick, barely clear of the ground. It does not move far.
EYES: none. One knot-hole high on the trunk, half hidden behind the top plate.

The 3 cells, in this exact order:

Cell 1 — standing braced behind its plates, the top plate tilted forward like a shield, leaning into it. Immovable rather than resting.
Cell 2 — the shove. Driven forward with the plated side leading, the column compressed short and thick behind it, two straight speed lines. The plates do not deform.
Cell 3 — struck. Two plates have been knocked loose and are spinning away, the rot underneath torn open, the column buckled at the gap.

STYLE (strict, non-negotiable):
- 1-bit monochrome pixel art. ONLY two colors: pure black #000000 and pure white #FFFFFF.
- NO grayscale, NO anti-aliasing, NO gradients, NO soft edges, NO blur, NO color fringing.
- Shading ONLY via 1-bit checkerboard dithering (alternating black/white pixels).
- Chunky, clearly visible square pixels — every pixel must be a crisp hard-edged square.
- Background: solid pure black. Subjects drawn in pure white outlines and dithered fills.
- NEVER put a white, light, or filled panel behind a subject — the ground is always black.
- Retro handheld / early-1990s monochrome LCD game aesthetic. Think "Downwell", "Minit",
  and the 1-bit look of "Return of the Obra Dinn".
- No watermarks, no signatures, no sparkle marks in the corners.
- No borders or frames around the whole image.

CAMERA — SLIGHT HIGH-ANGLE SIDE VIEW (three-quarter). This is not a flat side view.

- The camera sits a little ABOVE the character and slightly to the side, looking down
  at roughly 15-20 degrees. You can see a little of the top of the shoulders and the
  upper surface of the boots.
- The body is turned about 20 degrees toward the viewer from pure profile — the far
  shoulder is visible behind the near one, and you can see both eyes on the face.
- The FEET sit slightly forward and lower than the torso, as if standing on a floor
  plane that recedes upward into the background. This is the single most important
  part: the game draws a receding floor under this sprite, and a flat side-on figure
  will look like it is standing in a different world from the ground.
- Facing RIGHT. Every frame faces right. The game mirrors sprites in code where it
  needs them facing the other way — never draw a left-facing frame.

NEVER DRAW THE GROUND.

The game draws its own floor under these sprites (a receding quarter-view plane) and
composites the artwork on top of it. Anything floor-like inside a cell lands on the
screen as a white slab sitting in mid-air.

So there is NO ground line, NO horizon, NO floor plane, NO paving, NO grass, NO dirt,
NO rubble, NO cracks, NO drop shadow, and NO dust lying on a surface. Not even a thin
line under the feet.

THE GROUND IS IMPLIED BY THE POSE, NOT DRAWN. Where a description says a weapon is
"planted in the ground", or a knee is "on the floor", or something "bursts out of the
ground", it means: draw the figure and the effect at that height, standing on nothing.
The bottom of the boots, the point of the blade, the base of the burst — they simply
stop, with pure black beneath them.

Contact is sold by the POSE (a bent knee, a braced arm, a low burst opening upward),
never by drawing what is being touched.

IT STANDS. IT NEVER LIES DOWN.

The floor is a receding quarter-view plane and the sprite is simply composited on
top of it. That works for something STANDING, because the bottom of the shape meets
the floor along one clear line. It cannot work for something LYING FLAT: a wide
shallow pool, a puddle, a slick, a thing spread out across the ground has no such
line, and the floor cannot draw itself around it. It lands on screen as a sticker
glued to the floor, and no amount of drawing inside the sprite will fix it, because
the fix would have to happen in the floor.

So nothing here is drawn as a flat spread pool, a stain, or anything poured out
across a surface, however heavy or liquid it is meant to be. Every creature has real
height. Drips hang in empty black and simply stop; they never pool or spread at the
bottom.

(A creature the description below says FLOATS is the other allowed case, and it is
the opposite of lying down, not an exception to it: it hangs clear of the ground
with empty black beneath it, so there is no contact to sell at all. What is banned
is the middle case — something spread out ON the floor.)

WEIGHT IS SHOWN BY SAGGING, NOT BY LYING. A heavy creature stands and loses the
fight with its own weight: the middle bulges out sideways past the base, the base
spreads and loads, the top slumps and overhangs to one side, and long drips hang off
the underside. That reads as heavy at 45 pixels. Flat does not — flat just reads as
small.

SILHOUETTE — this is the whole job.

Four of these stand overlapping on a 138px-tall stage, each about 40-52 pixels
across. At that size there is no colour, no texture, and no face to read. The ONLY
thing that tells one enemy from another is the OUTLINE.

So the shape must be decided, not decorated:
- Pick one bold silhouette and commit to it. State it to yourself in five words.
- The three cells keep that silhouette. Only the pose inside it changes.
- Details that vanish below 50px are wasted ink: a row of twenty small teeth, thin
  antennae, surface speckle. The answer is FEWER AND BIGGER, never NONE — six teeth
  the length of a finger read fine at 45px, while a mouth with no teeth at all reads
  as a pebble.
- Do NOT rely on shading to separate parts. Two shapes that touch must differ in
  outline, not in fill.

IT IS A MONSTER. IT IS NOT A MASCOT.

BANNED, all of it:
- Big round sparkly eyes with white catchlights. No cartoon shine dots.
- Any smile, any open happy mouth, any blush, any raised cheeks.
- Symmetrical, tidy, egg-smooth outlines. Nothing that looks moulded.
- Chibi proportions — a huge head on a small body, a face filling half the shape.
- Anything you would put on a sticker.
- Anything that would pass unremarked in a field guide to real animals. If a
  naturalist could label it and move on, it is not a monster yet.

IT IS OLD WOOD THAT MOVES. IT IS NOT AN ENT.

Two failures to avoid, and the second is the common one.

The first is a friendly tree-person: a trunk with a kind bearded face and two arm
branches, standing straight. That is a storybook character, not an enemy.

The second is a REAL TREE. Asked for a walking tree, every model draws a handsome
oak with roots for feet. The player then fights forestry. A tree with legs is still
a tree.

WHAT IS RIGHT: wood that has been dead a long time and started moving anyway. It
should look like something that fell over years ago and got back up wrong.

APPLY ALL FOUR:

1. IT IS BROKEN AND IT KEPT GOING. The trunk is snapped, split, or hollowed through,
   and it did not heal — it grew around the damage. A hole you can see the black
   through is the single strongest shape in this chapter; use it.

2. IT LEANS. Nothing here stands straight. The mass is off its own centre, held up
   by whatever is under it, so the silhouette is a diagonal rather than a column.
   A straight upright trunk reads as scenery every time.

3. THE ROOTS ARE THE LIMBS. What it moves on came out of the ground and is still
   shaped like roots — thick, splayed, uneven in number, clotted with earth. Not
   legs, not feet, never boots. Three or five, never a tidy pair.

4. THE GRAIN IS TORN, NOT DRAWN. Bark shows as a few big hard splits and one or two
   deep gouges. NEVER as fine parallel lines or surface texture — at 45 pixels that
   turns to grey mush and the shape disappears with it.

EYES: none, or holes. Knots and hollows in the wood do the looking. Where the
description below asks for a light in one, it is a small hard shape deep inside a
hole, not an eye drawn on the surface.

IT IS TALLER THAN EVERYTHING BEFORE IT. This chapter follows the vine wood, where
nothing rose above waist height. Here every mob stands over a person. That change in
the height of the enemy line is how the player knows the chapter turned, and it is
read before any individual creature is.

BANNED: bearded tree faces, neat bark texture, healthy green canopies, symmetrical
branching, anything that would pass in a woodland illustration.

IT IS ALIVE AND IT IS COMING FOR YOU.

Not a prop, not an icon, not a mascot standing to attention. Every cell should read
as a creature that is about to do something. Even the resting frame leans forward.

Facing LEFT is wrong. Draw it facing RIGHT; the game mirrors it in code so it turns
to face the party.

NOTHING MAY BE CUT OFF.
- It fills about 64% of the cell height.
- Cell 2 is the widest. Size the sheet from it.
- Every cell holds the WHOLE creature plus every loose droplet and speed line. If any of it touches a magenta line, that cell has failed.
- Leave at least 8px of empty black between the outermost pixel and every magenta line.

SHEET LAYOUT:
- Arrange the cells in an exact uniform grid: 3 columns x 1 row.
- Separate every cell with 4px-wide solid MAGENTA (#FF00FF) lines, including a magenta
  border around the outer edge of the whole sheet.
- Magenta appears ONLY on these separator lines, never inside a cell.
- Every cell is exactly the same size. Reading order is left to right, then top to
  bottom.
- Do not add extra rows of variants. Exactly 1 row, exactly 3 cells.
- EVERY CELL MUST BE SQUARE. With a 3x1 grid that means the whole sheet is
  3:1 — output it at 1536x512.
  A square cell is required. A tall narrow cell cannot hold a weapon swung forward,
  and a short wide cell cannot hold one raised. Both have been tried and both
  clipped.

## 다시 뽑을 때

**바닥이 그려져 나왔을 때**

```
The ground must not be drawn. Remove the floor line, the shadow, the puddle and any
rubble. Everything below the creature is pure black. Keep the poses exactly as they
are — only delete the ground.
```

**세 칸이 서로 다른 생물처럼 나왔을 때**

```
All three cells are the SAME creature — same outline, same size, same eyes, same
markings. Only the pose changes between them. Redraw them as one animation, not as
three separate drawings.
```

**너무 작게 그려 나왔을 때**

```
The creature is drawn too small inside its cell. Redraw it filling about 80% of
the cell height, centred, with the empty space distributed around it rather than
below it.
```
