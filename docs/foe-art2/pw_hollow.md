ABSOLUTE RULE — NO TEXT OF ANY KIND:
- Do NOT write, print, label, caption, title, name, or number ANYTHING.
- There is NO caption area, NO name plate, NO banner, NO scroll of text, NO signature.
- Every cell is artwork EDGE TO EDGE. Nothing is written above, below, or beside the art.
- This includes English, Korean, numerals, roman numerals, runes, and fake alien script.
- A cell containing even one letter-like mark is a failed output.

SUBJECT: a 3-frame animation sheet of ONE single creature, left to right. The creature is in every cell.

THE CREATURE (the same one in all 3 cells):
A trunk that rotted through the middle and did not fall.
BODY: TALL AND LEANING — half again as tall as it is wide, and the whole mass is tipped well off vertical.
THE HOLE IS THE READ. A large opening goes CLEAN THROUGH the trunk at chest height — you can see black sky through it. It is nearly a third of the width of the body and it breaks the silhouette from the inside. Nothing else in this set has a hole through it; protect this above everything.
THE RIM of the hole is ragged and splintered inward, and FIVE LONG SPLINTERS point in toward the middle of the opening like teeth. That is where it takes things in.
CAUGHT ON THE LOWER RIM, hanging half inside: A RIBCAGE, pale, one side broken away.
THE TOP is snapped off at an angle, not rounded, with three or four hard splinters standing up.
ROOTS: three thick ones, splayed, one much longer than the others.
EYES: none. Two smaller knot-holes above the big hole, uneven, black.

The 3 cells, in this exact order:

Cell 1 — standing tilted and still, the hole facing you, the ribcage hanging in it. The stillness is what makes it read as waiting.
Cell 2 — the lunge. The whole trunk has swung forward from the roots like a falling post, the hole thrown ahead and its splinters closing inward. The ribcage swings out.
Cell 3 — struck. The trunk has cracked across at the hole, the opening torn wide and crooked, the upper half folding over. Splinters and the broken ribcage flying.

STYLE (strict, non-negotiable):
- 1-bit monochrome pixel art. ONLY two colors: pure black #000000 and pure white #FFFFFF.
- NO grayscale, NO anti-aliasing, NO gradients, NO soft edges, NO blur, NO color fringing.
- Shading ONLY via 1-bit checkerboard dithering (alternating black/white pixels).
- Chunky, clearly visible square pixels — every pixel must be a crisp hard-edged square.
- Background: solid pure black. Subjects drawn in pure white outlines and dithered fills.
- NEVER put a white, light, or filled panel behind a subject — the ground is always black.
- Retro handheld / early-1990s monochrome LCD game aesthetic. Think "Downwell", "Minit",
  and the 1-bit look of "Return of the Obra Dinn".
- No watermarks, no signatures, no sparkle marks in the corners.
- No borders or frames around the whole image.

CAMERA — SLIGHT HIGH-ANGLE SIDE VIEW (three-quarter). This is not a flat side view.

- The camera sits a little ABOVE the character and slightly to the side, looking down
  at roughly 15-20 degrees. You can see a little of the top of the shoulders and the
  upper surface of the boots.
- The body is turned about 20 degrees toward the viewer from pure profile — the far
  shoulder is visible behind the near one, and you can see both eyes on the face.
- The FEET sit slightly forward and lower than the torso, as if standing on a floor
  plane that recedes upward into the background. This is the single most important
  part: the game draws a receding floor under this sprite, and a flat side-on figure
  will look like it is standing in a different world from the ground.
- Facing RIGHT. Every frame faces right. The game mirrors sprites in code where it
  needs them facing the other way — never draw a left-facing frame.

NEVER DRAW THE GROUND.

The game draws its own floor under these sprites (a receding quarter-view plane) and
composites the artwork on top of it. Anything floor-like inside a cell lands on the
screen as a white slab sitting in mid-air.

So there is NO ground line, NO horizon, NO floor plane, NO paving, NO grass, NO dirt,
NO rubble, NO cracks, NO drop shadow, and NO dust lying on a surface. Not even a thin
line under the feet.

THE GROUND IS IMPLIED BY THE POSE, NOT DRAWN. Where a description says a weapon is
"planted in the ground", or a knee is "on the floor", or something "bursts out of the
ground", it means: draw the figure and the effect at that height, standing on nothing.
The bottom of the boots, the point of the blade, the base of the burst — they simply
stop, with pure black beneath them.

Contact is sold by the POSE (a bent knee, a braced arm, a low burst opening upward),
never by drawing what is being touched.

IT STANDS. IT NEVER LIES DOWN.

The floor is a receding quarter-view plane and the sprite is simply composited on
top of it. That works for something STANDING, because the bottom of the shape meets
the floor along one clear line. It cannot work for something LYING FLAT: a wide
shallow pool, a puddle, a slick, a thing spread out across the ground has no such
line, and the floor cannot draw itself around it. It lands on screen as a sticker
glued to the floor, and no amount of drawing inside the sprite will fix it, because
the fix would have to happen in the floor.

So nothing here is drawn as a flat spread pool, a stain, or anything poured out
across a surface, however heavy or liquid it is meant to be. Every creature has real
height. Drips hang in empty black and simply stop; they never pool or spread at the
bottom.

(A creature the description below says FLOATS is the other allowed case, and it is
the opposite of lying down, not an exception to it: it hangs clear of the ground
with empty black beneath it, so there is no contact to sell at all. What is banned
is the middle case — something spread out ON the floor.)

WEIGHT IS SHOWN BY SAGGING, NOT BY LYING. A heavy creature stands and loses the
fight with its own weight: the middle bulges out sideways past the base, the base
spreads and loads, the top slumps and overhangs to one side, and long drips hang off
the underside. That reads as heavy at 45 pixels. Flat does not — flat just reads as
small.

SILHOUETTE — this is the whole job.

Four of these stand overlapping on a 138px-tall stage, each about 40-52 pixels
across. At that size there is no colour, no texture, and no face to read. The ONLY
thing that tells one enemy from another is the OUTLINE.

So the shape must be decided, not decorated:
- Pick one bold silhouette and commit to it. State it to yourself in five words.
- The three cells keep that silhouette. Only the pose inside it changes.
- Details that vanish below 50px are wasted ink: a row of twenty small teeth, thin
  antennae, surface speckle. The answer is FEWER AND BIGGER, never NONE — six teeth
  the length of a finger read fine at 45px, while a mouth with no teeth at all reads
  as a pebble.
- Do NOT rely on shading to separate parts. Two shapes that touch must differ in
  outline, not in fill.

IT IS A MONSTER. IT IS NOT A MASCOT.

BANNED, all of it:
- Big round sparkly eyes with white catchlights. No cartoon shine dots.
- Any smile, any open happy mouth, any blush, any raised cheeks.
- Symmetrical, tidy, egg-smooth outlines. Nothing that looks moulded.
- Chibi proportions — a huge head on a small body, a face filling half the shape.
- Anything you would put on a sticker.
- Anything that would pass unremarked in a field guide to real animals. If a
  naturalist could label it and move on, it is not a monster yet.

IT IS OLD WOOD THAT MOVES. IT IS NOT AN ENT.

Two failures to avoid, and the second is the common one.

The first is a friendly tree-person: a trunk with a kind bearded face and two arm
branches, standing straight. That is a storybook character, not an enemy.

The second is a REAL TREE. Asked for a walking tree, every model draws a handsome
oak with roots for feet. The player then fights forestry. A tree with legs is still
a tree.

WHAT IS RIGHT: wood that has been dead a long time and started moving anyway. It
should look like something that fell over years ago and got back up wrong.

APPLY ALL FOUR:

1. IT IS BROKEN AND IT KEPT GOING. The trunk is snapped, split, or hollowed through,
   and it did not heal — it grew around the damage. A hole you can see the black
   through is the single strongest shape in this chapter; use it.

2. IT LEANS. Nothing here stands straight. The mass is off its own centre, held up
   by whatever is under it, so the silhouette is a diagonal rather than a column.
   A straight upright trunk reads as scenery every time.

3. THE ROOTS ARE THE LIMBS. What it moves on came out of the ground and is still
   shaped like roots — thick, splayed, uneven in number, clotted with earth. Not
   legs, not feet, never boots. Three or five, never a tidy pair.

4. THE GRAIN IS TORN, NOT DRAWN. Bark shows as a few big hard splits and one or two
   deep gouges. NEVER as fine parallel lines or surface texture — at 45 pixels that
   turns to grey mush and the shape disappears with it.

EYES: none, or holes. Knots and hollows in the wood do the looking. Where the
description below asks for a light in one, it is a small hard shape deep inside a
hole, not an eye drawn on the surface.

IT IS TALLER THAN EVERYTHING BEFORE IT. This chapter follows the vine wood, where
nothing rose above waist height. Here every mob stands over a person. That change in
the height of the enemy line is how the player knows the chapter turned, and it is
read before any individual creature is.

BANNED: bearded tree faces, neat bark texture, healthy green canopies, symmetrical
branching, anything that would pass in a woodland illustration.

IT IS ALIVE AND IT IS COMING FOR YOU.

Not a prop, not an icon, not a mascot standing to attention. Every cell should read
as a creature that is about to do something. Even the resting frame leans forward.

Facing LEFT is wrong. Draw it facing RIGHT; the game mirrors it in code so it turns
to face the party.

NOTHING MAY BE CUT OFF.
- It fills about 66% of the cell height.
- Cell 2 is the longest. Size the sheet from it.
- Every cell holds the WHOLE creature plus every loose droplet and speed line. If any of it touches a magenta line, that cell has failed.
- Leave at least 8px of empty black between the outermost pixel and every magenta line.

SHEET LAYOUT:
- Arrange the cells in an exact uniform grid: 3 columns x 1 row.
- Separate every cell with 4px-wide solid MAGENTA (#FF00FF) lines, including a magenta
  border around the outer edge of the whole sheet.
- Magenta appears ONLY on these separator lines, never inside a cell.
- Every cell is exactly the same size. Reading order is left to right, then top to
  bottom.
- Do not add extra rows of variants. Exactly 1 row, exactly 3 cells.
- EVERY CELL MUST BE SQUARE. With a 3x1 grid that means the whole sheet is
  3:1 — output it at 1536x512.
  A square cell is required. A tall narrow cell cannot hold a weapon swung forward,
  and a short wide cell cannot hold one raised. Both have been tried and both
  clipped.

## 다시 뽑을 때

**색이 반전돼 나왔을 때** (바탕이 희고 그림이 검음)

```
The values are inverted. In this image the creature has come out as DARK shapes
sitting on a LIGHT ground — or as a light-filled panel with the creature drawn
into it in black.

It must be the other way round. THE GROUND IS PURE BLACK AND IT IS EMPTY. The
creature is drawn in PURE WHITE on top of it: a white filled silhouette, with its
interior detail — eyes, mouth, seams, the gaps between limbs — cut back OUT of that
white as black holes.

There is no light background, no panel, no card, no frame, no vignette and no white
rectangle anywhere. If you flood-fill the corner of a cell it must run all the way
around the creature without meeting a wall.

Keep the design, the pose and the proportions exactly as they are. Only the values
swap.
```

**선만 남았을 때** (덩어리 없이 가는 획이 엉킴)

```
The creature has come out as a tangle of thin white strokes with no solid mass
anywhere. At game size those strokes merge into each other and it reads as a
smudge, not a creature.

It needs a BODY. Find the single largest part of it — the trunk, the abdomen, the
head, the main mound — and draw that as ONE SOLID FILLED WHITE MASS at least a
third of the creature's height, with hard unbroken edges. Everything thin (limbs,
vines, branches, tendrils, antennae) grows OUT of that mass and must be at least
three pixels thick where it leaves it.

Fewer, thicker parts. Delete half the thin strokes; make the survivors twice as
thick. Keep the pose and the identity exactly as they are.
```

**흰 덩어리로 나왔을 때** (실루엣 안이 통째로 메워짐)

```
The creature has come out as a solid white silhouette with no interior detail. At
game size it reads as a white blob and nothing else.

The palette is two colours: white and transparent. Depth and detail are drawn as
BLACK GAPS INSIDE the white mass, not as shading. Redraw with real holes: the gap
between the legs, the dark seam between every pair of plates, the hollow of the
open mouth, the black centre of each eye socket, the space under an overhanging
part. At least a fifth of the area inside the outline must be black.

Keep the outline and the poses exactly as they are. Only open up the inside.
```

**바닥이 그려져 나왔을 때**

```
The ground must not be drawn. Remove the floor line, the shadow, the puddle and any
rubble. Everything below the creature is pure black. Keep the poses exactly as they
are — only delete the ground.
```

**세 칸이 서로 다른 생물처럼 나왔을 때**

```
All three cells are the SAME creature — same outline, same size, same eyes, same
markings. Only the pose changes between them. Redraw them as one animation, not as
three separate drawings.
```

**너무 작게 그려 나왔을 때**

```
The creature is drawn too small inside its cell. Redraw it filling about 80% of
the cell height, centred, with the empty space distributed around it rather than
below it.
```
