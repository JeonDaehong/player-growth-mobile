| 하는 일 | 5초 뒤 스스로 터진다. 그 전에 잡아야 한다. |

26판 우두머리(피로스)가 죽으면 넷이 나옵니다. 5초 안에 못 잡으면 각자
터져서 파티가 최대 체력의 25% 씩 맞습니다.

## 피로스의 조각으로 보여야 합니다

마디 넷, 갈라진 살갗, 속 빈 발광 기관 — 셋 다 피로스에게 있던 것입니다.
앞쪽 끝이 **찢어진 단면**인 것이 결정적입니다: 머리가 아니라 잘려 나온
자리입니다.

## 제일 작아야 합니다

게임에서 제일 작은 생물입니다 (34%). 우두머리 하나가 서 있던 자리에 넷이
서므로, 작지 않으면 자리가 안 납니다.

## 2번 칸은 터지기 **직전**입니다

터지는 그림이 아닙니다. 아무것도 몸을 안 떠났고, 갈라진 자리만 활짝 벌어져
있습니다. 터진 것을 그리면 화면에서는 이미 늦은 것으로 보입니다.

ABSOLUTE RULE — NO TEXT OF ANY KIND:
- Do NOT write, print, label, caption, title, name, or number ANYTHING.
- There is NO caption area, NO name plate, NO banner, NO scroll of text, NO signature.
- Every cell is artwork EDGE TO EDGE. Nothing is written above, below, or beside the art.
- This includes English, Korean, numerals, roman numerals, runes, and fake alien script.
- A cell containing even one letter-like mark is a failed output.

SUBJECT: a 3-frame animation sheet of ONE single creature, left to right. The creature is in every cell.

THE CREATURE (the same one in all 3 cells):
A piece of the firefly that is still counting.
BODY: a SHORT fat grub, almost as tall as it is long — the ROUNDEST silhouette in the region. FOUR segments only, each one swollen past the next, the last one biggest. It is over-full and it looks it.
THE LIGHT CHAMBER — this one only: the whole rear segment is a hard HOLLOW chamber, drawn as a thick ring with a black centre packed with a coarse grid of small cells. It is more than a third of the whole creature and it is the only hollow shape on it. That is the part that goes off.
THE SKIN IS SPLITTING: between every pair of segments the surface has cracked open into a short gash — three of them — and pale edges show.
LEGS: four tiny hooked pairs bunched under the front, barely reaching the ground. It waddles.
HEAD: very small, a hard capsule with two short mouth plates and two dull dots for eyes. It is a fraction of the body and it does not matter.
IT IS A PIECE OF SOMETHING BIGGER: the front end is not a proper head end — it is a torn CROSS-SECTION, a ragged open ring where it separated from the parent, with the plate edges standing out around it.

The 3 cells, in this exact order:

Cell 1 — squat and swollen, barely off the ground, the light chamber plainly visible at the back, the three gashes closed to slits. The torn front section faces forward. It is the SMALLEST and ROUNDEST thing on the field.
Cell 2 — about to go. The body has REARED up onto the back segment, front end lifted clear of the ground, and all three gashes have GAPED into wide openings along the whole length. The light chamber has swelled to half again its size and its inner grid is broken apart. Nothing has left the body yet — that is the point. It is the moment before.
Cell 3 — struck. The light chamber is cracked across and its grid is scattered; two segments have burst along their gashes and the body has flattened sideways. The torn front ring is crushed out of round. It is coming apart harmlessly, which is exactly what the player wanted.

STYLE (strict, non-negotiable):
- 1-bit monochrome pixel art. ONLY two colors: pure black #000000 and pure white #FFFFFF.
- NO grayscale, NO anti-aliasing, NO gradients, NO soft edges, NO blur, NO color fringing.
- Shading ONLY via 1-bit checkerboard dithering (alternating black/white pixels).
- Chunky, clearly visible square pixels — every pixel must be a crisp hard-edged square.
- Background: solid pure black. Subjects drawn in pure white outlines and dithered fills.
- NEVER put a white, light, or filled panel behind a subject — the ground is always black.
- Retro handheld / early-1990s monochrome LCD game aesthetic. Think "Downwell", "Minit",
  and the 1-bit look of "Return of the Obra Dinn".
- No watermarks, no signatures, no sparkle marks in the corners.
- No borders or frames around the whole image.

CAMERA — SLIGHT HIGH-ANGLE SIDE VIEW (three-quarter). This is not a flat side view.

- The camera sits a little ABOVE the character and slightly to the side, looking down
  at roughly 15-20 degrees. You can see a little of the top of the shoulders and the
  upper surface of the boots.
- The body is turned about 20 degrees toward the viewer from pure profile — the far
  shoulder is visible behind the near one, and you can see both eyes on the face.
- The FEET sit slightly forward and lower than the torso, as if standing on a floor
  plane that recedes upward into the background. This is the single most important
  part: the game draws a receding floor under this sprite, and a flat side-on figure
  will look like it is standing in a different world from the ground.
- Facing RIGHT. Every frame faces right. The game mirrors sprites in code where it
  needs them facing the other way — never draw a left-facing frame.

NEVER DRAW THE GROUND.

The game draws its own floor under these sprites (a receding quarter-view plane) and
composites the artwork on top of it. Anything floor-like inside a cell lands on the
screen as a white slab sitting in mid-air.

So there is NO ground line, NO horizon, NO floor plane, NO paving, NO grass, NO dirt,
NO rubble, NO cracks, NO drop shadow, and NO dust lying on a surface. Not even a thin
line under the feet.

THE GROUND IS IMPLIED BY THE POSE, NOT DRAWN. Where a description says a weapon is
"planted in the ground", or a knee is "on the floor", or something "bursts out of the
ground", it means: draw the figure and the effect at that height, standing on nothing.
The bottom of the boots, the point of the blade, the base of the burst — they simply
stop, with pure black beneath them.

Contact is sold by the POSE (a bent knee, a braced arm, a low burst opening upward),
never by drawing what is being touched.

IT STANDS. IT NEVER LIES DOWN.

The floor is a receding quarter-view plane and the sprite is simply composited on
top of it. That works for something STANDING, because the bottom of the shape meets
the floor along one clear line. It cannot work for something LYING FLAT: a wide
shallow pool, a puddle, a slick, a thing spread out across the ground has no such
line, and the floor cannot draw itself around it. It lands on screen as a sticker
glued to the floor, and no amount of drawing inside the sprite will fix it, because
the fix would have to happen in the floor.

So nothing here is drawn as a flat spread pool, a stain, or anything poured out
across a surface, however heavy or liquid it is meant to be. Every creature has real
height. Drips hang in empty black and simply stop; they never pool or spread at the
bottom.

(A creature the description below says FLOATS is the other allowed case, and it is
the opposite of lying down, not an exception to it: it hangs clear of the ground
with empty black beneath it, so there is no contact to sell at all. What is banned
is the middle case — something spread out ON the floor.)

WEIGHT IS SHOWN BY SAGGING, NOT BY LYING. A heavy creature stands and loses the
fight with its own weight: the middle bulges out sideways past the base, the base
spreads and loads, the top slumps and overhangs to one side, and long drips hang off
the underside. That reads as heavy at 45 pixels. Flat does not — flat just reads as
small.

SILHOUETTE — this is the whole job.

Four of these stand overlapping on a 138px-tall stage, each about 40-52 pixels
across. At that size there is no colour, no texture, and no face to read. The ONLY
thing that tells one enemy from another is the OUTLINE.

So the shape must be decided, not decorated:
- Pick one bold silhouette and commit to it. State it to yourself in five words.
- The three cells keep that silhouette. Only the pose inside it changes.
- Details that vanish below 50px are wasted ink: a row of twenty small teeth, thin
  antennae, surface speckle. The answer is FEWER AND BIGGER, never NONE — six teeth
  the length of a finger read fine at 45px, while a mouth with no teeth at all reads
  as a pebble.
- Do NOT rely on shading to separate parts. Two shapes that touch must differ in
  outline, not in fill.

IT IS A MONSTER. IT IS NOT A MASCOT.

BANNED, all of it:
- Big round sparkly eyes with white catchlights. No cartoon shine dots.
- Any smile, any open happy mouth, any blush, any raised cheeks.
- Symmetrical, tidy, egg-smooth outlines. Nothing that looks moulded.
- Chibi proportions — a huge head on a small body, a face filling half the shape.
- Anything you would put on a sticker.
- Anything that would pass unremarked in a field guide to real animals. If a
  naturalist could label it and move on, it is not a monster yet.

WHAT THESE ARE.

Insects that grew past the size an insect can be. Not bug mascots, not armoured
knights with antennae. Segmented, chitinous animals built out of hard plates.

- THE BODY IS A CHAIN OF PLATES. They overlap like roof tiles, each a little
  different from the last, with a soft dark gap between every pair. That repeating
  rhythm is what says "insect" at 45 pixels. Protect it above any single detail.
- LEGS COME OUT OF THE SIDES, NOT THE BOTTOM, and they bend the WRONG WAY at the
  knee — up first, then down. They are thin, hard, and end in a single hook.
- THEY ARE NEVER SYMMETRICAL. One leg is shorter, one antenna is snapped, one
  plate is chipped. A mirrored insect reads as an ornament.
- MOUTHPARTS OPEN SIDEWAYS. Two or four hard plates hinging left and right. A jaw
  that hinges up and down is a mammal's jaw and it is wrong here.
- NO FACE AND NO EXPRESSION. Eyes are compound: solid domes pitted with a coarse
  grid, or clusters of small round ones. Never a pupil, never a brow.
- THE OLD SKIN IS STILL ON IT. One split hollow plate hangs off the back, empty
  and dry, the same shape as the living plate beneath it.

THEY ARE NOT WET. The slime chapter owns drips; do not borrow them. These are dry,
hard and dusty.

IT IS ALIVE AND IT IS COMING FOR YOU.

Not a prop, not an icon, not a mascot standing to attention. Every cell should read
as a creature that is about to do something. Even the resting frame leans forward.

Facing LEFT is wrong. Draw it facing RIGHT; the game mirrors it in code so it turns
to face the party.

NOTHING MAY BE CUT OFF.
- It fills about 34% of the cell height — the SMALLEST creature in the game. Four of them stand where one boss stood.
- Cell 2 is the tallest. Size the sheet from it.
- Every cell holds the WHOLE creature plus every loose droplet and speed line. If any of it touches a magenta line, that cell has failed.
- Leave at least 8px of empty black between the outermost pixel and every magenta line.

SHEET LAYOUT:
- Arrange the cells in an exact uniform grid: 3 columns x 1 row.
- Separate every cell with 4px-wide solid MAGENTA (#FF00FF) lines, including a magenta
  border around the outer edge of the whole sheet.
- Magenta appears ONLY on these separator lines, never inside a cell.
- Every cell is exactly the same size. Reading order is left to right, then top to
  bottom.
- Do not add extra rows of variants. Exactly 1 row, exactly 3 cells.
- EVERY CELL MUST BE SQUARE. With a 3x1 grid that means the whole sheet is
  3:1 — output it at 1536x512.
  A square cell is required. A tall narrow cell cannot hold a weapon swung forward,
  and a short wide cell cannot hold one raised. Both have been tried and both
  clipped.

## 다시 뽑을 때

**흰 덩어리로 나왔을 때** (실루엣 안이 통째로 메워짐)

```
The creature has come out as a solid white silhouette with no interior detail. At
game size it reads as a white blob and nothing else.

The palette is two colours: white and transparent. Depth and detail are drawn as
BLACK GAPS INSIDE the white mass, not as shading. Redraw with real holes: the gap
between the legs, the dark seam between every pair of plates, the hollow of the
open mouth, the black centre of each eye socket, the space under an overhanging
part. At least a fifth of the area inside the outline must be black.

Keep the outline and the poses exactly as they are. Only open up the inside.
```

**바닥이 그려져 나왔을 때**

```
The ground must not be drawn. Remove the floor line, the shadow, the puddle and any
rubble. Everything below the creature is pure black. Keep the poses exactly as they
are — only delete the ground.
```

**세 칸이 서로 다른 생물처럼 나왔을 때**

```
All three cells are the SAME creature — same outline, same size, same eyes, same
markings. Only the pose changes between them. Redraw them as one animation, not as
three separate drawings.
```

**너무 작게 그려 나왔을 때**

```
The creature is drawn too small inside its cell. Redraw it filling about 80% of
the cell height, centred, with the empty space distributed around it rather than
below it.
```
